# Privacy Policy for Vistarak Reminder App

**Effective Date:** 27 February 2026

Vistarak (“we”, “our”, or “us”) built the **Reminder App** (“App”) as a reminders and notifications tool. This Privacy Policy explains what information the App handles, how it is used, and your choices.

## 1. Information We Handle

The App may handle the following information:

- **Reminder content you create** (for example: title, notes, todo items, reminder time, repeat settings).
- **Notification-related data** needed to schedule and show reminders on your device.
- **Basic device/app state data** required for app functionality (for example, local app preferences and local storage state).

## 2. How Information Is Used

We use information only to provide core app functionality, including:

- Creating, saving, and updating reminders.
- Scheduling local notifications and alarms.
- Displaying reminder details and status in the App.

## 3. Data Storage and Processing

- Reminder data is stored **locally on your device** using app local storage.
- We do **not require account sign-in** to use core reminder features.
- We do **not intentionally sell your personal data**.

## 4. Data Sharing

We do not share your reminder content with third parties except when required by law.

The App may rely on platform services (Android/iOS system notification services) to deliver scheduled notifications.

## 5. Permissions

Depending on platform/version, the App may request permissions such as:

- **Notifications permission** (to show reminder alerts).
- **Alarm-related permission** (to schedule exact alarms where supported).

If you deny these permissions, reminder notifications may not function correctly.

## 6. Retention and Deletion

- Reminder data is retained on your device until you delete reminders or uninstall the App.
- Uninstalling the App typically removes app-local data from your device (subject to device backup settings).

## 7. Children’s Privacy

The App is not directed to children under 13. We do not knowingly collect personal information from children under 13.

## 8. Security

We use reasonable measures to protect app data handled on-device. However, no method of storage or transmission is completely secure.

## 9. International Users

If you use the App from outside your home country, your data handling is subject to the laws of your location and applicable platform policies.

## 10. Changes to This Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. We will post the updated version with a revised Effective Date.
